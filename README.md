## üçï Getting Started 

Here we will setup our development environment. But first, we will need to install the following tools.

**Steps**
1. Clone the repository to local machine using command git clone `repo link` 
For frontend - `git clone https://github.com/sonaljain067/noblenest`
For backend - `https://github.com/sonaljain067/noblenest_backend`

2. Navigate to project directory through command line

3. Install the required project dependencies by running `npm install`

4. Start the development server by running `npm run dev`


This will start the backend application at http://localhost:8000 and frontend application on your local machine at http://localhost:5174/. 
You can then open this URL in your web browser to view the application.
